# C++ Streams

## What this repo is

In this repo I tried to copy the functionality of Java's streams. Mostly for my own purposes.

## Note

Since I wrote it for my own purposes, it's basically a dumbed down version of what Java has and this doesn't use lazy evaluation like Java's so it's probably a lot slower.  
Other than these, I tried keeping it similar to Java's.
